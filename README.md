# Siegefend
Siegefend is a tower defense game whose goal is to resist the siege by placing turrets all along the route, so that these will knock down waves of enemies and prevent them from reaching the end of the path.

## Development Notes
* In Javadoc, use the form `{@code <value>}` if you want to enter a value like `true` or `false`;
* `@param`, `@return`, `@throws` etc. don't have to end with a dot or start with a capital letter, only the description itself must have both;
* If necessary, the description and `@return` can be the same;
* Wherever possible add a link to the type used via `{@link type}` in the description of parameters, exceptions or alike.

For these conventions I relied on Java's basic interfaces documentation.
